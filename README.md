                                                 Rock paper scissor
                       Welcome to our rock, paper, scissors game! You will be playing against the computer. 
                       The rules of the game are simple. You input a letter that represents either rock, paper or 
                       scissors. R is rock, P is paper and S is scissors. Rock beats scissors, 
                       paper beats rock and scissors beats paper. Each round that you win, you gain a point. 
                       If you lose, the computer gains a point and if you tie no one gets the point. To quit the game,
                       input Q. When you quit the game, your score will be shown and whoever has the most points 
                       will win the game!
