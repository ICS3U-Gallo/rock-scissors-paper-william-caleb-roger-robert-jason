                                                 Rock paper scissor
                       Welcome to our rock, paper, scissors game! You will be playing against the computer. 
                       The rules of the game are simple. You input a letter that stands for rock, paper and 
                       scissors. R is rock, P is paper, S is scissors, and q is quit. Rock beats Scissors, 
                       Paper beats rock and scissors beats paper. Each round that you win, you gain a point. 
                       If you lose, the computer gains a point and if you tie no one gets the point. When 
                       you quit the game, your score will be shown and whoever has the most points will win 
                       the game!
